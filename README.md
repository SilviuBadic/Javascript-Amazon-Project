Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a grid of 3-by-3 squares, usually drawn on a piece of paper, and can be played by people of any age. <br><br>
In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.

I wanted to customise it a bit by choosing to add two more features the start and reset button, as well as the output which announces if there's a winner or it's a tie.

## Lessons Learned
It was a good project to learn more about DOM manipulations and the relation between functions. Also a good way to improve my CSS skills too.
## Optimizations.

- DOM manipulation, functions, iterations, loops;
- Event listeners;
- Using of "this" keyword.
