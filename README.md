# Amazon Website
This is a fully responsive clone Amazon website in which we can add items or delete items from our shopping cart. I was mainly focused on interactivity this time. My credits to supersimple.dev for helping me with all the CSS and HTML base and also the tutorial for this project. I was focused on creating dynamic cart functionality as I said, real-time order summary updates, delivery options, and an intuitive user interface as the real Amazon project has and also on reusable components by creating modular code structures. User can choose from multimple delivery dates, with costs dynamically adjusted in real time.

## Features
1. Display product list with details about each items and update the quantity directly in the checkout page, with real-time updates to the final order.
2. Adjust the shopping cart by adding, removing the items in the cart.
3. Update the delivery dates depeding on the product and the shipping taxes.
4. Calculate the total order, depending on the sum of products, taxes and estimated shipping time.
5. Dymanic update button: Press enter to display the number of quantity or just click Update button.

## Lessons Learned
It helped me better organize my code. I've worked more on interactivity than in other projects, such as handling events with button click for example, updating the DOM in the real time. I've organized my code by writing reusable code and modular functions. I've improved also my understanding of JavaScript by implementing dynamic calculations for taxes, shipping and order totals.
## Optimizations.

- DOM manipulation, functions, objects, event listeners;
- Real-time Updates;
- Reusable code;
